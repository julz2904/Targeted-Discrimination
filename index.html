  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="color:black;">Targeted discrimination is a type of discrimination that aims towards a group of individuals of a specific race, background, culture, etc. It is used to cause harm and to hate / harass people based off of their identity or their qualities. Targeted discrimination has been seen all throughout history and has been prevalent through many significant times. There are many examples of targeted discrimination, and many officials have worked hard to get rid of segregation and racism. To be more specific, discrimination includes age discrimination, disability discrimination, sexual orientation, status as a parent, religious discrimination, national origin, pregnancy, sexual harassment, discrimination against a person's race, color and sex, and reprisal / retaliation. These are just a few of the many types of discrimination. Using discrimination is very damaging to peoples' cultures, their history, and overall to themselves. Some examples of discrimination include someone saying hurtful things or attacking you repeatedly, being made fun of, being excluded or left out, being ganged up on, being made to do hurtful or inappropriate things, and being threatened. There are many many more ways that people use to discriminate against others. Statistical discrimination is another type of discrimination.</p>

  <h2>Issues Caused By Targeted Discrimination</h2>
  <p style="color:black;">There are many issues caused by targeted discrimination, such as harassment (physical, sexual, etc.), bullying, hate, physical harm, exploitation, blackmail, and many more. These issues cause great deals of damage physically and mentally, and many people are blind to these issues and simply don't care, which is an issue in itself.
