    <h1>Targeted Discrimination - Where It's Seen</h1>

    <p style="color:black;">Targeted discrimination is commonly seen on social media and anywhere that a person can express their opinions towards others. It's not only used on the internet for people to see publicly, but also privately, like in private messaging and conversations. It is seen a lot in media and news, as there are many recurring issues. Another common place that targeted discrimination is seen is in the workplace. This is more of a private setting, and it is sometimes exhibited when someone is in a job interview. For example: John is an immigrant and wants to apply for a job at a banking company. He goes to the interview and doesn't get the job. He's told it is because he doesn't have enough work experience, but what he doesn't know is that the real reason he doesn't meet the requirements is because the supervisor doesn't want immigrants working at the company. This is an example of discrimination, but more specifically racism and racial discrimination in the workplace.</p>

    <p style="color: black;">A good example of targeted discrimination is with advertising. Facebook is one example of a company who had to release a notice about not discriminating against others as it is not tolerated, after they used the data collected from accounts to target users based off of their race.</p>
