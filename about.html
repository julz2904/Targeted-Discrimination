    <h2>History</h2> 
    <p style="color:black;">Discrimination has been an issue in America for hundreds of years. Honestly speaking, it's inescapable. In our history, we've seen many forms of racism with segregation, and there were plenty of times where people did not have the ability to use their basic human rights, let alone have them. African Americans had to undergo many treacherous years to get their rights back and to be equal to those that are white. To this day, people of color do have rights, but they don't get treated as humans like everyone else and are still heavily discriminated against. The Segregation Era lasted from 1900 to 1939, and the Civil Rights Act happened in 1964, when people of color were given the ability to do more things and weren't treated as horribly. This was a long fight for freedom and rights, and many people risked their lives to ensure that all African Americans then and after will have equal rights and freedom. Despite what you may think happened after the Civil Rights Act, to this day people of color still don't have all the rights they should have. By law, all citizens, regardless of race, gender, religion, etc., have equal rights and the same abilities to life and freedom as everyone else. But just because the law says these things doesn't mean that is what's happening in the United States. People of color are still discriminated against despite having more rights and freedom now.</p><br>

    <p style="color:black;">The main events that happened in the 1900's for equality and freedom for all include: The Segregation Era (1900-1939), Worl War II and Post War (1940-1949), The Civil Rights Era (1950-1963), The Civil Rights Act of 1964, and more. What many people don't know is that African Americans weren't the only ones fighting for equality; white people were actually helping to give more rights to people of color. This isn't widely discussed as it was mostly African Americans themselves who fought for their rights, but some white people used their rights and power to help within this era.</p><br>
