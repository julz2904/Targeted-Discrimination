    <h2>History</h2> 
    <p style="color:black;">Discrimination has been an issue in America for hundreds of years. Honestly speaking, it's inescapable. In our history, we've seen many forms of racism with segregation, and there were plenty of times where people did not have the ability to use their basic human rights, let alone have them. People of color had to undergo many treacherous years to get their rights back and to be equal to those that are white. To this day, people of color do have rights, but they don't get treated as humans like everyone else and are still heavily discriminated against. The Segregation Era lasted from 1900 to 1939, and the Civil Rights Act happened in 1964, when people of color were given the ability to do more things and weren't treated as horribly. This was a long fight for freedom and rights, and many people risked their lives to ensure that all people of color then and after will have equal rights and freedom. Despite what you may think happened after the Civil Rights Act, to this day people of color still don't have all the rights they should have. By law, all citizens, regardless of race, gender, religion, etc., have equal rights and the same abilities to life and freedom as everyone else. But just because the law says these things doesn't mean that is what's happening in the United States. People of color are still discriminated against despite having more rights and freedom now.</p><br>

    <p style="color:black;">The main events that happened in the 1900's for equality and freedom for all include: The Segregation Era (1900-1939), World War II and Post War (1940-1949), The Civil Rights Era (1950-1963), The Civil Rights Act of 1964, and more. What many people don't know is that people of color weren't the only ones fighting for equality; white people were actually helping to give more rights to people of color. This isn't widely discussed as it was mostly people of color themselves who fought for their rights, but some white people used their rights and power to help others within this era. A notable group of people were the Black Panthers or the Black Panther Party. The Black Panther Party was a political organization founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale to challenge police brutality against the African American community. At its peak in 1968, the Black Panther Party had roughly 2,000 members, but slowly those numbers decreased because of internal tensions, deadly shootouts, and FBI counterintelligence activities aimed towards weakening the organization. Newton and Seale created the Ten-Point Program, which called for an immediate end to police brutality, asking for employment for African Americans, and asking for land, housing and justice for all. The Black Panthers were a part of the larger Black Power movement, which heavily emphasized Black pride, community control, and unification for civil rights. The Black Panthers were often portrayed as a gang, but were merely an organization seen as a political party whose main goal was to get more African Americans elected to political office. However, they were unsuccessful. By the early 1970's, FBI counterintelligence efforts, criminal activities, and an internal rift between group members weakened the party as a political force. On a good note, they did start a number of popular community social programs, which include free breakfast programs for school children and free health clinics in 13 African American communities across the United States. </p><br>
