    <p style="color:black;">Targeted discrimination is a type of discrimination that aims towards a group of individuals of a specific race, background, culture, etc. It is used to cause harm and to hate / harass people based off of their identity or their qualities. Targeted discrimination has been seen all throughout history and has been prevalent through many significant times. There are many examples of targeted discrimination, and many officials have worked hard to get rid of segregation and racism.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">To be more specific, discrimination includes age discrimination, disability discrimination, sexual orientation, status as a parent, religious discrimination, national origin, pregnancy, sexual harassment, discrimination against a person's race, color and sex, and reprisal / retaliation. These are just a few of the many types of discrimination. Using discrimination is very damaging to peoples' cultures, their history, and overall to themselves.</p>
